# Currency-Converter-html-css-js
How It Works:
HTML (index.html):

The structure is similar to the previous example, with input fields for the amount, currency dropdowns, a button to convert, and sections for the result and conversion history.
CSS (styles.css):

The styling is simple and clean, with emphasis on usability and readability.
JavaScript (script.js):

The script fetches the latest currency exchange rates from api.exchangerate-api.com, which does not require an API key for basic usage.
The conversion happens when the user clicks the "Convert" button, and the result is displayed along with the history.
Instructions:
Download and Unzip: Copy the code into your respective files (index.html, styles.css, and script.js).
Open in Browser: Open index.html in your browser to start using the currency converter.
This simple application will allow you to convert currencies and see your conversion history without needing an API key.
